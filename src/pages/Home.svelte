      I am a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the Medical University of South
      Carolina (<strong>MUSC</strong>), working under the supervision of Dr.
      Bethany Wolf (add hyperlink) and Dr. Dongjun Chung (add hyperlink).

      My current research is focused on developing approaches to integrate
      genomic data with functional annotation data applied to complex autoimmune
      diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis,
      ulcerative colitis, Crohnâ€™s disease). More generally, my research is
      focused on identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs that
      influence complex diseases while also identifying potential mechanisms
      linking disease-associated SNPs to the disease.

      Aside from independent research, I also enjoy multidisciplinary
      collaborations, and have worked with clinicians, epidemiologists, and
      basic and translational science researchers on multiple projects. I
      usually work alongside my collaborators to define research questions,
      design studies, perform statistical analysis, discuss results and coauthor
      manuscripts.

      Before joining MUSC, I received a MS degree in Mathematics (statistics
      concentration) from ETSU (add hyperlink), and a BS degree in Math
      (actuarial science emphasis) and BA in Economics from MSUM (add
      hyperlink).
